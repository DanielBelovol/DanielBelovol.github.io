## Main Project

### ThumbnailTester
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/DanielBelovol/ThumbnailTester)

**ThumbnailTester** is a commercial project designed for testing YouTube thumbnails and analyzing video statistics.  
I actively participated in the development of this project, which involved creating backend services, handling data collection via APIs, and building dynamic WebSocket-based test configurations.

It allows you to:

- Run A/B tests for thumbnails and titles
- Collect detailed statistics: views, average watch duration, CTR, watch time
- Configure tests dynamically via WebSocket API
- Support Google authorization and test configuration management

Additionally, I contributed to **Feedzy**, a commercial project that is still in development, focusing on backend features and integration of analytics services.
